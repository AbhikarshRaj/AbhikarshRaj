## Projects
Here are some of the projects I've worked on:

### [AI Snake Game](https://github.com/AbhikarshRaj/AI_snake_game)
**Description:** Used AI and ML models to train a Snake game to achieve high scores. This project explores the intersection of artificial intelligence and gaming using reinforcement learning techniques, specifically Deep Q Learning (DQN). The AI agent learns to play the Snake game autonomously by navigating a grid, consuming food items, and avoiding collisions, all while maximizing cumulative rewards over time.

**Highlights:**
- Leveraged reinforcement learning, a trial-and-error-based training method, where the agent interacts with the environment and receives feedback through rewards or penalties.
- Utilized Deep Q Learning, integrating Q-Learning with neural networks to handle complex, high-dimensional state spaces efficiently.
- The model iteratively explored various actions to strike a balance between exploration and exploitation, ultimately mastering the game.

**Technologies Used:**
- Reinforcement Learning concepts: agent, environment, state, action, reward, and policy.
- Deep Neural Networks for approximating the Q-function.

**Goal:** Showcase reinforcement learning's capabilities in gaming and explore its real-world applications in unpredictable, dynamic environments.
